# 2023-C++-Backup
My first laboratory works in learning the C++ programming language
Here I will leave all the codes from the labs that I did during the first semester of 2023 at my university. Some tasks do not contain a full name because they contain some photographs, but the solution is located inside the codes. It is also possible that the translation may be crooked in some places, since I translated them into English through a translator
